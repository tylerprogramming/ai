- issues with function calling connected with LM Studio.  GPT function calling works, but as soon as the config is swapped for localhost to LM Studio, they are ignored
- NEED to make sure that if using LM Studio, set the UserAgent to have a default auto reply to "..." or something.  LM Studio complains about this because of the interaction\
